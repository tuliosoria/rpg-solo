# UI Updates for Stat System Overhaul - FINAL

## Changes Made to RpgSolo_lite.tsx

### 1. **Stats Display Logic**
- **Before**: Stats shown when `gameState.hasSkills` is true
- **After**: Stats shown when `gameState.upgradeSelected` exists
- **Benefit**: Stats are properly hidden until the upgrade mechanic is introduced

### 2. **Stat Visual Enhancement**
- **Before**: All stats displayed in the same green color
- **After**: Upgraded stat is highlighted in green (#00ff88), others are dimmed (#666)
- **Benefit**: Clear visual indication of which stat was upgraded

### 3. **Stat Value Logic**
- **Before**: Used `Math.min(10, prev.stat + 5)` for upgrades
- **After**: Direct assignment to 10 for upgraded stat
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more predictable stat calculation

### 4. **Base Stat Values**
- **Confirmed**: Base stats are 5 (Tech: 5, Logical: 5, Empathy: 5)
- **Confirmed**: Upgraded stat becomes 10 (5 base + 5 upgrade)
- **Confirmed**: Non-upgraded stats remain at 5

## Testing Status

✅ **Stats Hidden Initially**: Player starts without seeing stats
✅ **Stats Shown After Upgrade**: Stats appear after selecting neural upgrade
✅ **Correct Stat Values**: Base 5, upgraded 10
✅ **Visual Highlighting**: Upgraded stat is highlighted in green
✅ **Tutorial Skill Check**: d20 animation working with proper calculations
✅ **Dynamic Result Text**: Success/failure generates appropriate story text

## Story Flow Verification

1. **wake_1** → ... → **skill_select** (Choose upgrade)
2. **skill_technical/logical/empathic** (Upgrade applied, stats now visible)
3. **tutorial_skill_check** (Tutorial skill check with d20 roll)
4. **tutorial_check_result** (Dynamic result based on roll)
5. Continue with Chapter 1...

## Final State

- ✅ No stat bonuses in Chapter 1 choices (except upgrade)
- ✅ Base stats: Tech 5, Logical 5, Empathy 5
- ✅ Upgrade system: +5 to selected stat (max 10)
- ✅ Stats hidden until upgrade selection
- ✅ Tutorial skill check after upgrade
- ✅ d20 animation and proper calculations
- ✅ Dynamic result text generation

The stat system overhaul is now complete and functional!
