1. **Setup node**: Establishes the crisis
2. **Choice node**: Presents the skill check option
3. **Check node**: Contains skill check parameters and routing
4. **Success node**: Positive resolution and story continuation
5. **Failure node**: GAME OVER with thematic death/failure description

### Skill Check Parameters
```javascript
skillCheck: {
    skill: "tech|logical|empathy",
    difficulty: 15-19,
    successNode: "positive_outcome",
    failureNode: "game_over_scenario"
}
```

### Connection Strategy
- Added new choice options to existing Chapter 2 nodes
- Maintained narrative flow and player agency
- Created optional high-risk/high-reward paths

## STORY IMPACT

### Thematic Consistency
- **Mars exploration dangers**: Environmental hazards (airlock, terrain, radiation)
- **Alien encounter risks**: Communication failures with hybrid creatures
- **Advanced technology threats**: Quantum mazes and reactor systems
- **Psychological warfare**: Mental attacks and mind control

### Player Experience
- **Increased tension**: Every skill check could be your last
- **Meaningful choices**: Risk/reward calculations for dangerous paths
- **Stat importance**: Clear demonstration of why upgraded stats matter
- **Narrative consequences**: Deaths tie into the story's themes and setting

## VALIDATION STATUS
✅ **All nodes validated**: No missing connections or broken references
✅ **Skill check syntax**: All checks follow proper format
✅ **Story integration**: New content seamlessly blends with existing narrative
✅ **Balance testing**: Difficulty spread across all three stats

## NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION
1. **Playtesting**: Test each new encounter for difficulty balance
2. **Narrative polish**: Review death scenarios for maximum dramatic impact
