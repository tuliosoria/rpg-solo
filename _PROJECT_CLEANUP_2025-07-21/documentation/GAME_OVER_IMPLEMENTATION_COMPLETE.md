### React Component Structure
```tsx
// State management
const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false);
const [gameOverReason, setGameOverReason] = useState('');
const [gameStats, setGameStats] = useState<GameStats>({
  nodesVisited: 0,
  skillCheckAttempts: 0,
  skillCheckSuccesses: 0,
  skillCheckFailures: 0,
  chaptersCompleted: 0
});

// Game Over detection
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentNode && !loading && !isGameOver) {
    setGameStats(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      nodesVisited: prev.nodesVisited + 1
    }));
    
    const nodeText = currentNode.text;
    if (isGameOverNode(nodeText)) {
      setGameOverReason(extractGameOverReason(nodeText));
      setIsGameOver(true);
    }
  }
}, [current, currentNode, loading, isGameOver]);
```

### Stats Tracking Integration
