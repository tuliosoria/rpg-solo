# FINAL FIX - Stats Display Issue

## Problem Identified
The user was seeing stats displayed as "50" at the beginning of the game, but they should:
1. Be hidden until after the upgrade selection
2. Show correct values (5 base, 10 with upgrade)

## Root Cause
The application was using the wrong React component! 
- `page.tsx` imports `RpgSolo` from `./RpgSolo.tsx`
- But I was editing `RpgSolo_lite.tsx` instead
- The main `RpgSolo.tsx` had the old incorrect implementation

## Changes Made to RpgSolo.tsx

### 1. Updated GameState Type
```typescript
type GameState = {
  tech: number;
  logical: number;
  empathy: number;
  hasSkills: boolean;
  upgradeSelected?: 'tech' | 'logical' | 'empathy';  // Added this
};
```

### 2. Fixed Initial Stats Values
```typescript
// Before: tech: 50, logical: 50, empathy: 50
// After:  tech: 5, logical: 5, empathy: 5
```

### 3. Updated Stats Display Condition
```typescript
// Before: {gameState.hasSkills && (
// After:  {gameState.upgradeSelected && (
```

### 4. Added Visual Highlighting
- Upgraded stat: bright green (#00ff88)
- Non-upgraded stats: dimmed (#666)

### 5. Enhanced Upgrade Logic
Added proper upgrade handling logic that:
- Detects when player reaches upgrade nodes
- Sets the selected stat to 10
- Sets upgradeSelected to track which upgrade was chosen
- Makes stats visible after upgrade selection

### 6. Added Story Stats Loading
Updated useEffect to load initial stats from story.json playerStats.

## Result
✅ Stats are hidden initially
✅ Stats appear only after upgrade selection  
✅ Correct values: base 5, upgraded 10
✅ Visual highlighting of upgraded stat
✅ Proper upgrade selection logic

The issue is now completely resolved!
