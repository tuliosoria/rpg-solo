# D20 Skill Check Enhancement - Mars Signal Analysis

## Overview
Enhanced the tutorial skill check with improved d20 animation and specialized Mars signal analysis based on the player's chosen neural upgrade.

## Key Features Added

### ðŸŽ² **Enhanced D20 Animation**
- **Longer Animation**: 15 iterations instead of 10
- **Faster Spin**: 80ms intervals for more dynamic movement
- **Larger Dice**: 100x100px with enhanced styling
- **Visual Effects**: Glowing border, enhanced shadows, 3D appearance
- **Custom Text**: "ANALYZING MARS SIGNAL..." instead of generic skill check

### ðŸ§  **Upgrade-Specific Analysis**

#### **Logical Upgrade**
- **Success**: Identifies potential sources (probe, research station, communication attempt)
- **Failure**: Acknowledges data is contradictory and inconclusive
- **Focus**: Scientific analysis and logical deduction

#### **Tech Upgrade** 
- **Success**: Reveals quantum encryption protocols and advanced transmission methods
- **Failure**: Overwhelmed by complex technical encryption
- **Focus**: Technical specifications and transmission analysis

#### **Empathy Upgrade**
- **Success**: Detects emotional resonance, consciousness, and intent behind the signal
- **Failure**: Senses intention but can't interpret alien consciousness
- **Focus**: Emotional undertones and conscious intent

### ðŸŽ¨ **UI Improvements**
