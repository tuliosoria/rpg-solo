# RPG Stat System Overhaul Report
**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Task:** Remove stat bonuses from choices, implement base stats and upgrade system

## ‚úÖ **CHANGES COMPLETED**

### üìä **New Stat System Design**

#### **Base Stats (Starting Values)**
- **Tech:** 5
- **Logical:** 5  
- **Empathy:** 5

All players begin with identical capabilities, ensuring fair and balanced gameplay.

#### **Neural Upgrade System**
- **Single Choice:** Player selects one neural upgrade during Chapter 1
- **Upgrade Bonus:** +5 to selected stat
- **Maximum Cap:** Stats cannot exceed 10
- **Specialization Options:**
  - **Logical Upgrade:** 5 ‚Üí 10 Logical (Analysis, Science, Problem-solving)
  - **Empathic Upgrade:** 5 ‚Üí 10 Empathy (Emotions, Relationships, Ethics)
  - **Technical Upgrade:** 5 ‚Üí 10 Tech (Engineering, Hacking, Systems)

### üéÆ **Interactive Choices (No Stat Effects)**

#### **Enhanced 12 Choice Nodes**
All 12 interactive choice nodes now focus on **narrative personality development** rather than stat accumulation:

1. **wake_2** - Recognition approach to replica status
2. **wake_6** - Identity philosophy responses  
3. **wake_8** - First movement reactions
4. **wake_15** - Mars mission enthusiasm types
5. **wake_18** - Replica 37 investigation methods
6. **wake_23** - Lucy relationship approaches
7. **wake_25** - Laboratory familiarity responses
8. **wake_26** - Past life exploration preferences
9. **wake_27** - Ethics and consent viewpoints
10. **wake_29** - Launch preparation attitudes
11. **wake_30** - Ship-brain integration questions
12. **wake_41** - Final cryosleep mindset

**Key Change:** Choices now develop **character personality** and **story experience** without affecting combat/skill capabilities.

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### **story.json Updates**
- Removed all `"effects": { "stat": value }` from choice objects
- Maintained `"effects": {}` structure for future compatibility
- Preserved upgrade test configuration:
  - `"upgradeBonus": 5`
  - `"maxStat": 10`
  - Base stats: `"tech": 5, "logical": 5, "empathy": 5`

#### **RpgSolo_lite.tsx Updates**
- Updated `handleChoice()` function to detect upgrade nodes
- Added special logic for `skill_logical`, `skill_empathic`, `skill_technical` nodes
- Implemented stat upgrade: `Math.min(10, prevStat + 5)`
- Maintained upgrade tracking: `upgradeSelected` field

#### **File Backups Created**
- `story_backup_before_stat_removal_2025-06-23.json` - Full backup before changes
- Original choice effects preserved for reference

### üéØ **Gameplay Impact**

#### **Before (Old System)**
- 12 choice nodes with +3 to +8 stat bonuses
- Possible stat ranges: 41-67 total points
- Complex optimization decisions
- Stat grinding through choices

#### **After (New System)**
- 12 choice nodes with narrative-only effects
- Fixed stat totals: 20 points (15 base + 5 upgrade)
- Single meaningful upgrade decision
- Focus on roleplay over optimization

#### **Benefits**
- **Simplified:** One major character decision instead of 12 stat calculations
- **Balanced:** All players have equal mechanical capabilities
- **Narrative-Focused:** Choices matter for story, not stats
- **Replayable:** 3 distinct specialization paths
- **Strategic:** Upgrade choice impacts all future skill checks

### üìã **Skill Check System**

#### **D20 System (Unchanged)**
- Roll: 1d20 + stat vs DC
- **Easy:** DC 10 
- **Medium:** DC 15
- **Hard:** DC 20

#### **Stat Modifiers**
- **Base Stats (5):** +5 modifier to rolls
- **Upgraded Stat (10):** +10 modifier to rolls
- **Specialization Advantage:** Upgraded stat gives significant edge in relevant challenges

#### **Tutorial Integration**
- Post-upgrade skill check remains in place
- Tests the player's chosen specialization
- Demonstrates the +10 modifier advantage

### üéâ **MISSION COMPLETE**

**Dr. Korvain - Replica 43** now features a **clean, balanced stat system** that:

‚úÖ **Equalizes starting conditions** (5/5/5 base stats)  
‚úÖ **Eliminates stat grinding** through story choices  
‚úÖ **Focuses on meaningful specialization** via single upgrade choice  
‚úÖ **Maintains narrative depth** with 12 personality-shaping decisions  
‚úÖ **Preserves challenge scaling** through D20 + stat system  
‚úÖ **Enhances replayability** with 3 distinct character paths  

**The game now emphasizes story immersion and strategic specialization over stat optimization, creating a more focused and enjoyable solo RPG experience.**

## üìù **Next Steps**

1. **Chapter 2 Development:** Design skill checks that leverage each specialization
2. **Narrative Branches:** Create paths that reward different upgrade choices  
3. **Advanced Challenges:** Implement multi-stat skill check scenarios
4. **User Testing:** Validate the balanced progression system

**Ready for expanded story development with a robust, balanced character system!**
