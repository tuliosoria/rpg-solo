# Game Improvement Ideas

## Narrative & Immersion

- **Multiple endings**
  - Bad ending: get caught by the system
  - Neutral ending: escape but files are lost
  - Good ending: current victory flow
  - Secret ending: find hidden truth about UFO74's identity

- **UFO74 has a secret** - Reveal they're actually an insider/witness, not just a hacker. Maybe they were there in 1996.

- **Time pressure mechanic** - Real-time countdown after triggering certain files, not just command-based. Adds urgency.

- **Unreliable narrator** - Some "evidence" is planted disinformation; player must discern truth from fabrication.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Stealth meter visible** - Show detection level more prominently in the UI, with visual/audio warnings at thresholds.

- **File corruption spreads** - Reading unstable files can corrupt nearby files over time. Creates consequences for exploration.

- **Hidden commands** - Discoverable through reading certain documents (like `trace`, `recover`). Reward thorough players.

- **Password puzzles** - Find passwords scattered in documents to unlock deeper files. Connect the dots.

- **Mini-games** - Decryption could be a simple cipher puzzle, not just Q&A. More engaging interaction.

## Atmosphere

- **Sound design**
  - Keyboard clicks on typing
  - Static/interference sounds
  - Modem dial-up sounds
  - Eerie ambient background
  - Alert beeps on warnings

- **Random glitches** - Unprompted screen distortions as tension builds. The system "fighting back."

- **"They're watching" moments** - Occasional messages suggesting someone else is in the system. Paranoia fuel.

- **Easter eggs**
  - Real Varginha incident references
  - X-Files nods ("the truth is out there")
  - Brazilian culture touches (dates, locations, names)
  - 90s internet culture references

---

## Replayability

- **Achievements**
  - "Speed Run" - Complete in under X commands
  - "Pacifist" - Win with low detection level
  - "Completionist" - Read every file
  - "Ghost" - Never trigger any warnings
  - "Curious" - Find all easter eggs

---

## Meta/ARG Elements

- **External website** - Fake government site or "leaked documents" page that players can visit IRL.

- **QR codes in game** - Hidden in certain files, lead to real-world Varginha incident info or bonus content.

---

## Priority Ideas (Quick Wins)

1. Sound design - huge atmosphere boost
2. Stealth meter visibility - better player feedback
3. Random glitches - easy to implement, high impact
4. "They're watching" moments - tension builder
5. Achievements - adds replayability without major changes

---

## Backlog (Future Consideration)

- Randomized file locations (different playthrough = different paths)
- New Game+ (start with UFO74 trusting you more, earlier access)
