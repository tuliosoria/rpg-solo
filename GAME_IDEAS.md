# Game Improvement Ideas

## Narrative & Immersion

- ✅ **Multiple endings**
  - Bad ending: get caught by the system (countdown expires)
  - Neutral ending: escape but files are lost (disconnect command)
  - Good ending: current victory flow
  - Secret ending: find hidden truth about UFO74's identity (password puzzle)

- ✅ **UFO74 has a secret** - Reveal they're actually an insider/witness, not just a hacker. They were there in January 1996.

- ✅ **Time pressure mechanic** - Real-time countdown after triggering active_trace.sys. 5 minutes to complete or get caught.

- ✅ **Unreliable narrator** - Some "evidence" is planted disinformation (official_summary_report); subtle flag when discovered.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- ✅ **Stealth meter visible** - Show detection level more prominently in the UI, with visual/audio warnings at thresholds.

- ✅ **File corruption spreads** - Reading core_dump_corrupted.bin corrupts nearby files in /tmp. Creates consequences for exploration.

- ✅ **Hidden commands** - `disconnect` and `scan` discoverable through reading maintenance_notes.txt. Reward thorough players.

- ✅ **Password puzzles** - Password "varginha1996" found in transfer_authorization.txt, unlocks ghost_in_machine.enc for secret ending.

- ✅ **Mini-games** - `decode` command for ROT13 cipher puzzles. Hints provided after failed attempts.

## Atmosphere

- ✅ **Sound design**
  - Keyboard clicks on typing
  - Static/interference sounds
  - Modem dial-up sounds
  - Eerie ambient background
  - Alert beeps on warnings

- ✅ **Random glitches** - Unprompted screen distortions as tension builds. The system "fighting back."

- ✅ **"They're watching" moments** - Occasional messages suggesting someone else is in the system. Paranoia fuel.

- **Easter eggs**
  - Real Varginha incident references
  - X-Files nods ("the truth is out there")
  - Brazilian culture touches (dates, locations, names)
  - 90s internet culture references

---

## Replayability

- ✅ **Achievements**
  - "Speed Run" - Complete in under X commands
  - "Pacifist" - Win with low detection level
  - "Completionist" - Read every file
  - "Ghost" - Never trigger any warnings
  - "Curious" - Find all easter eggs

---

## Meta/ARG Elements

- **External website** - Fake government site or "leaked documents" page that players can visit IRL.

- **QR codes in game** - Hidden in certain files, lead to real-world Varginha incident info or bonus content.

---

## Priority Ideas (Quick Wins) - ALL COMPLETE ✅

1. ✅ Sound design - huge atmosphere boost
2. ✅ Stealth meter visibility - better player feedback
3. ✅ Random glitches - easy to implement, high impact
4. ✅ "They're watching" moments - tension builder
5. ✅ Achievements - adds replayability without major changes

## Backlog (Future Consideration)

- Randomized file locations (different playthrough = different paths)
- New Game+ (start with UFO74 trusting you more, earlier access)
- Easter eggs (X-Files references, Brazilian culture)
- External website / ARG elements
- QR codes in game
