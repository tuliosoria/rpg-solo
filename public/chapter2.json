The text was etched into steel with the precision of someone who understood that permanence was the only true rebellion against time.\n\nThe inscription pulsed with subtle bioluminescence—alive, watching, judging:\n\n\"I am one.\nI am twenty-eight.\nI am the echo and the first word.\nAsk what I am.\"\n\nThe riddle felt like a mirror reflecting her soul back at her in fragments. One original. Twenty-eight copies. The echo of a life that had learned to speak its own name in defiance of death.\n\nChronos: \"This may be a logic gate. Recommend input.\"\n\nBut logic gates were binary, predictable. This was something far more dangerous: a consciousness testing whether she truly understood what she was. The wrong answer would mean more than failure—it would mean erasure.",

Error messages cascaded through her visual cortex like digital blood.\n\nChronos: \"Neural backlash—get away from the door!\"\n\nBut movement was impossible. The feedback loop had found her central processors, turning her own consciousness against itself. She was drowning in static that tasted like copper and failure.\n\nIt was too late.\n\nAs darkness claimed her vision, one final thought echoed through dying circuits: She had given the wrong name to something that knew exactly who she was.\n\n**GAME OVER**\n\n*Some doors only open for those who understand what they truly are.*",
