🟦 CHAPTER 3 – THE HEART OF THE STRUCTURE

“Mama?”
The voice faded like mist.
Korvain stopped in the corridor.
She turned to darkness. Silence returned.
→ [Listen closely to the voice] → chapter3_2

NODE: chapter3_2
Korvain: “What was that voice?”

Chronos: “Do not trust voices in places like this.”
→ [Keep walking cautiously] → chapter3_3

NODE: chapter3_3
The corridor narrowed.
Three paths split ahead.
Chronos: “Infrared shows no activity. But something’s humming.”
Korvain: “Why is it so dark? I saw solar panels. Wind collectors.”
Chronos: “Power source intact. Lighting system disabled.”
→ [Ask about enhancements] → chapter3_4

NODE: chapter3_4
Korvain: “You can see, though.”
Chronos: “Replica vision upgraded after Replica 15 incident.”
Korvain: “What happened to her?”
Chronos: “…Classified.”
Korvain: “Anything else I should know?”
Chronos: “Yes. Also classified.”
→ [Examine surroundings] → chapter3_5

Inside, pod after pod.
Suspended in gel: the Earth Council President, the General, others.
All asleep. All Replicas.
→ [Ask Chronos what this is] → chapter3_9

NODE: chapter3_7
Corridor Center – The Datacore
The air shimmered. Racks of ancient machinery blinked.
Korvain: “I’ve never seen computers like these.”
Chronos: “I am not authorized to interpret this.”
→ [Try to connect to the network] → chapter3_10

NODE: chapter3_8
Corridor Right – The Room
Hermetically sealed.
On the bed: a girl.
Brown curls. Green eyes.
Lucy. Twelve years old. A Replica.
→ [Speak to the girl] → chapter3_23

NODE: chapter3_9
Chronos: “This is… blasphemy. Replicas of forbidden personnel.”
Korvain: “Why? Why copy them?”
Chronos: “This violates Treaty 7. We must report to Earth immediately.”
Static.
→ [Ask Chronos what's wrong] → chapter3_10b

NODE: chapter3_10b

Everything felt heavier.
Chronos: “This facility was never meant to exist.”
→ [Consider implications] → chapter3_14

NODE: chapter3_14
