# Chapter 2 Reset - June 23, 2025

## What Went Wrong

The Chapter 2 implementation became overly complex and broken due to:

1. **Inconsistent Narrative** - Mixed up Lucy's location (she should be on Earth, not Mars)
2. **Broken Node Connections** - Many nodes had incomplete or missing choice structures
3. **Overcomplicated Story Flow** - Too many branching paths without clear narrative focus
4. **JSON Syntax Errors** - Multiple structural issues in the JSON file
5. **Misaligned with Source Material** - Didn't follow the Chapter 2 Test.txt properly

## Backup Created

- **File**: `story_backup_chapter2_broken_2025-06-23.json`
- **Contains**: All the broken Chapter 2 content for reference

## What We Need for Clean Chapter 2

Based on Chapter 2 Test.txt, we need:

1. **Simple Linear Progression**: Mars → Valley → Signal Source → Structure Entry
2. **Key Story Beats**:
   - Arrival on Mars
   - Discovery of the hidden structure
   - Entry into the organic/living structure  
   - Console recognition of Replica 43
   - Memory restoration about Lucy (who is on Earth)
   - Discovery of the Hive Core
   - Final choice about Earth's fate

3. **Proper Skill Checks**: Using the established format with clear consequences
4. **Clear Endings**: Multiple ending paths based on player choices

## Next Steps

1. Restore a clean story.json with just Chapter 1 + basic Chapter 2 start
2. Implement Chapter 2 step by step, following Chapter 2 Test.txt exactly
3. Test each node as we build it
4. Keep it simple and focused on the core narrative

## Key Lesson

Sometimes it's better to start over with a clear plan than to try to fix a broken implementation.
