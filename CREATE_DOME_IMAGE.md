# Creating dome.png for the game

## Option 1: AI Image Generation
Use an AI image generator with this prompt:
"A mysterious dome structure on Mars built from salvaged solar panels, wind collectors, and rover parts. Gothic cathedral made from technology. Red desert landscape. Atmospheric, eerie lighting. Dark sci-fi aesthetic."

## Option 2: Placeholder Creation
If you need a quick placeholder, you can:

1. Open any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a new image 800x600 pixels
3. Fill it with a dark reddish background
4. Add some basic geometric shapes to represent a dome structure
5. Save as "dome.png" in the /public directory

## Option 3: Download a Free Image
Search for royalty-free images of:
- Mars landscapes with structures
- Futuristic domes
- Abandoned space stations
- Sci-fi architecture

Make sure to respect copyright and licensing terms.

## File Location
The file should be placed at:
`/public/dome.png`

## Current Status
The game is configured to display the image and will show a placeholder until the file is added.
